This repository contains the working out / derivation of the formula to calculate the number of winning moves for a game of connect K on an m x n board. 
It may not be fully clear but it's the original working I did to come up with it, so I thought it'd be the most prudent to put here. 

However the formula relies on the assumption that it is possible to reach each winning state without encountering a win prior to reaching it.
Also this is for a single player - for 2 players then double this value.
